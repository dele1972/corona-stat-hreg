I want to store the daily published Corona data of my local region (Hanover). 
The cumulative reporting data are prepared and published daily on 
[this page](https://www.hannover.de/Leben-in-der-Region-Hannover/Verwaltungen-Kommunen/Die-Verwaltung-der-Region-Hannover/Region-Hannover/Aktuelle-Informationen-zum-Coronavirus-der-Region-Hannover).
The data are integrated either in tables or in continuous text, each with the same structure.

This project is just an illustrative project for me, because I always wanted to do something 
like this - collect data from a website and process it if necessary.
Basically I started too late to collect the data for nice analysis, because 
the first wave is already over. But I still follow the data and this way it 
is easier and clearer for me.
